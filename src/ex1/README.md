## What you are going to build
A todo app!  
Almost as cool as our boards, but with a bit less functionality.  
The requirements:
- [x] Import the relevant CSS (style.css) and JS (script.js) files - already done for you
- [x] Choose a name for your app and update the title to your app name
- [x] Add your app name in the top of the screen (see mock)
- [x] Build the layout according to the mock. (background, centered white box, etc...)
- [x] Add a textbox to be used for adding tasks
- [x] Add a button ("Add task")
- [x] When "Add task" button is clicked, add a task to the task list
- [x] Change the background and cursor type of an item when hovered on
- [x] When a list item is clicked, show 'alert' (**Hint**: check the [alert](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert) method) with the item name
- [x] Delete an item when "Delete" button is clicked


Bonus
- [x] Clear the input when a new item is added
- [x] Add input validation. e.g when the text input is empty, show a message with an error
- [x] Add "empty state" - when there are no items on the list, show some nice and inviting UI to encourage the user to add items
- [x] Add ability to sort the list by name -Added the ability to toggle between ascending and descending sort
- [x] Add task when enter key is pressed
- [x] Add animation when a new item is added
- [x] Added animation when item / all items are removed removed
- [x] have another cool idea? Go wild! 
- [x] show count of pending tasks
