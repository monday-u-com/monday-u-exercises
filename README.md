# Instructions:
Entering a task is done by pressing the plus button, when a task is added a "success" sound will be heard.

Each task can be marked as completed or it can be deleted. If you choose to delete a task, you will hear a sound announcing the deletion.

If there's an attempt to enter an empty task, a pop up message will appear. The same will happen when clicking on an existing task
