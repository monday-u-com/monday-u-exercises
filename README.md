Busy Day - Todo List:

Implemented the following: 
 Import the relevant CSS (style.css) and JS (script.js) files - already done for you
 Choose a name for your app and update the title to your app name
 Add your app name in the top of the screen (see mock)
 Build the layout according to the mock. (background, centered white box, etc...)
 Add a textbox to be used for adding tasks
 Add a button ("Add task")
 When "Add task" button is clicked, add a task to the task list
 Change the background and cursor type of an item when hovered on
 When a list item is clicked, show 'alert' (Hint: check the alert method) with the item name
 Delete an item when "Delete" button is clicked
Bonus

 Clear the input when a new item is added
 Add input validation. e.g when the text input is empty, show a message with an error
 Add "empty state" - when there are no items on the list, show some nice and inviting UI to encourage the user to add items
 Add ability to sort the list by name
 Add task when enter key is pressed
 Add animation when a new item is added
 have another cool idea? Go wild!
